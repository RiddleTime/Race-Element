<h1 id="dualsensex">DualSenseX</h1>
<p>A couple of a days ago I came accross an app called DualSenseX(DSX in short).
This app allowed me to send commands to the Playstation 5 controller so the triggers would actually react to braking force, traction control and abs.</p>
<p>The functionality to send these commands has been added to Race Element 0.2.4.0</p>
<p>Check out the guide in the discord how to get started and bring the experience with a Dual Sense to another level: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/962649775478558811/1164558784119705630">https://discord.com/channels/962649775478558811/1164558784119705630</a></p>
