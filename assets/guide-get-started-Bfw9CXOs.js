<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/RiddleTime/Race-Element/releases/latest" target="_blank">Download</a></strong> the app. The link will lead you to the latest version at GitHub.  </li>
<li>Place <strong>RaceElement.exe</strong> in any folder of My Documents. If the app is not located there you will encounter issues with the auto-updater.</li>
<li>Then simply run the app. Do <strong>not</strong> run it as admin, since this will prevent some features from working.</li>
</ol>
