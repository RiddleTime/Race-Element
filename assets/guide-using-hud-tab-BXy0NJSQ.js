You can activate a HUD by:</p>

<li>Right clicking whilst in the right side panel whilst a HUD is shown.</li>
</ul>

<p>By default the activated HUDs will only become visible once you are driving and the engine of the car is running.
Now if you want to have them showing at any time, you can enable the Always Visible mode, this is a Eye toggle-button on the bottom-left of the HUD tab.</p>
