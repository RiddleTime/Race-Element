<h1 id="race-element">Race Element</h1>
<p>Race Element is a lightweight application for sim racing that is designed to run with minimum system requirements. The question I asked myself when trying other HUD applications is: Why are all these apps abusing my cpu, ram and graphics card to a point where the lost performance is enough to buy another step up in graphics cards. That ends now!</p>
<p>Get started and download the app: <strong><a href="/guide/how-to-get-started">Download</a></strong></p>

<h1 id="huds-40">HUDs (40+)</h1>
<p>HUDs(Head-up displays) are 2D graphics that can be used to provide you data whilst driving. There are a various amount of HUDs that each provides you useful information in a minimalistic manner whilst being highly configurable.</p>
<ul>

<li>Modular</li>
<li>Custom Configuration</li>
<li>Very Low performance hit as the app doesn&#39;t use your gpu to render the HUDs.</li>

</ul>
<h1 id="data">Data</h1>
