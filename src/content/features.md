# Race Element
Race Element is a lightweight application for sim racing that is designed to run with minimum system requirements. The question I asked myself when trying other HUD applications is: Why are all these apps abusing my cpu, ram and graphics card to a point where the lost performance is enough to buy another step up in graphics cards. That ends now!

Get started and download the app: **[Download](/guide/how-to-get-started)**

# Supported Simulators
- Assetto Corsa Competizione (ACC)
- Assetto Corsa (work in progress)

# HUDs
HUDs(Head-up displays) are 2D graphics that can be used to provide you data whilst driving. There are a various amount of HUDs that each provides you useful information in a minimalistic manner whilst being highly configurable.
- Scalable
- Modular
- Custom Configuration
- Very Low performance hit as the app doesn't use your gpu to render the HUDs.
- Can be used for stream only

# Data
The app represents data recorded during driving into so called Race Weekend Databases(RWDB files). These Race Weekends can be viewed in the Data tab of the application and provide you essential information such as lap- and sectortimes, fuel usage and the conditions of each lap.

- Create the base for a Custom Livery on the fly, the days of manually setting up a custom livery are gone
